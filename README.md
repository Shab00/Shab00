## Projects & Status

- YouTube — "Red Pill" Content Analysis (completed)  
  - Finished a reproducible analysis: collected video metadata and comments, performed multi-model sentiment/emotion analysis and topic modelling, and produced notebooks and visualisations summarising engagement and themes.  
  - Notebooks & artifacts: [Link](https://github.com/Shab00/redPillYoutube)

- Football Match Outcome Prediction — SaaS & Business Simulation (in progress)  
  - Building an end-to-end pipeline (ingestion → feature engineering → LightGBM modeling → calibration → API). Working on MVP inference endpoint, calibration, and subscription delivery flow.  
  - Current focus: finalising model calibration, production snapshotting and the delivery pipeline (WhatsApp/Stripe integration).  
  - Repo / demo: [Link](https://github.com/Shab00/Over-Under2.5Goals)

- Marketplace Notifier — Pokémon Card WhatsApp Notifier (product experiment; on hold)  
  - Detects listings for specified Pokémon cards on marketplaces (eBay, etc.) and notifies subscribers via WhatsApp.  
  - Planned features: listing ingestion/scraping, matching rules, Twilio WhatsApp notifications and a subscription opt-in flow.  
  - Status: on hold while consulting stakeholders and completing the football project. Will resume once requirements are finalised.

## Spare Time

- Coding practice & C development  
  - Ongoing algorithms & data structures practice and C exercises (The C programming language, Head First C, Learn C the Hard Way).
  - Chess engine — Building a from‑scratch chess engine as a learning project. Implementing board/FEN I/O, robust move generation + make/unmake, perft tests for correctness, and a search stack (minimax → alpha‑beta → iterative deepening) with UCI support planned. Emphasis on correctness-first development, perft regression tests, and sanitizer-friendly code. Repo: [Link](https://github.com/Shab00/chessEngine)

## MSc & Coursework

- MSc Computing (in progress) — The Open University  
  - Current module: M816 Data Management (DAMA‑DMBOK2) — topics include data governance, data quality, metadata management, master data management, data architecture and lifecycle.  
  - I’m mapping module concepts to my projects and will publish governance & QA artifacts (e.g., governance markdown, metadata catalog, data-quality checks) as I complete them.
